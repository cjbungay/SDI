SAP HANA Enterprise Information Management comprises a set of data integration and data quality services that allow connecting to data sources and moving data into HANA and, with the speed advantages of HANA, transform and cleanse the data to make it more accurate and more useful. SAP HANA EIM integrates replication, transformation and federation technology in a single product, allowing developers to define replication tasks and transformation data flows through HANA’s modeling tools (HANA Studio and HANA Web-based Development Workbench). They can be configured to operate either in real time or in batch mode; and can be deployed on HANA instances either on premise or in the cloud. Finally, SAP HANA EIM’s connectivity architecture is open and extensible: it provides a set of out-of-the-box data source adapters which can access data both within and outside the customer’s firewall, and it provides an adapter SDK allowing developers to provide connectivity to data sources not covered.
